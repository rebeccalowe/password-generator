## User Story

As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria, therefore creating a strong password that provides greater security.


## Description

The Password Generator prompts users to select whether or not they would like to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters in their password, and will produce a strong, secure password meeting the user criteria accordingly. The website application is user-friendly and simple, while allowing for users to easily copy their newly generated password.
